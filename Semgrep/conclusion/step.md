#### Conclusion

Great! We hope you've enjoyed this concise tutorial on Semgrep and seen how easy it is to use. The goal of Semgrep is to be lightweight and based in the command line so you can easily use it without context switching and thus be more efficient. In addition, it inherently was built as an efficient and thus quick tool, meaning shorter runtime times and thus shorter pipeline runs. No more excuses regarding insecure code as a DevOps engineer!
