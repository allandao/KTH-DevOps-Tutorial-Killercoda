Welcome to a tutorial on ggshield (a GitGuardian tool) by Allan and Jun for the KTH Devops Course DD2482. 

What is GitGuardian?
"GitGuardian is a global cybersecurity startup focusing on code security solutions for the DevOps generation.

We'll focus on the GitGuardian CLI, called ggshield. It can also be used in a CI/CD environment to scan pipelines and to scan Docker images, but we'll simply be examining how to use it.
